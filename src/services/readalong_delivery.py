"""Deliver a generated
read-along EPUB into BookOrbit.

**Placement (load-bearing, do not deviate without re-deciding):**
the generated EPUB goes into the AUDIOBOOK's own BookOrbit entry, as a
secondary file written into that entry's folder on the shared ``/audiobooks``
mount, beside its real audio track(s) -- never into the ebook library folder,
never rewritten as an entry's primary ebook, and never touching
``Book.ebook_filename`` / ``Book.original_ebook_filename``. Doing this keeps
KOReader on the original EPUB and leaves the bridge's own ebook<->BookOrbit
mapping completely alone; only BookOrbit's own internal read-along sync
(dormant unless both formats resolve to the SAME entry -- see
``SyncManager._mark_bookorbit_readalong_mirror``) starts firing, and it does
so on a *different* entry than the one the bridge maps as this book's ebook,
so that guard stays dormant by construction.

**Why a new module instead of extending ``readalong_builder``:** Phases 1-4
are pure, filesystem-only EPUB generation -- paths in, bytes out, no network
calls, no notion that BookOrbit exists beyond being a source of file paths.
This step is delivery: it talks to the live BookOrbit API to resolve which
filesystem folder an audio entry's tracks actually live in, discover which
library to rescan, and confirm the scan's outcome. Keeping that live-API
surface out of ``readalong_builder`` keeps that module's own tests
network-free, and keeps this module's own tests focused on refusal/placement
logic without dragging in SMIL/OPF assembly.

**Idempotent replacement:** the generated file's name is derived
deterministically from the source EPUB's filename
(:func:`_readalong_filename`), so regenerating a book overwrites the same
path rather than accumulating a new file each run --
:func:`~src.services.readalong_builder.build_readalong_epub` repackages via
``zipfile.ZipFile(output_path, "w")``, which truncates and rewrites the file
in place, and BookOrbit's own incremental scan then re-indexes the same
relative path as an update rather than a new file.

    (never the whole entry -- the entry's real audio tracks, cover, etc. must
    survive). Always also removes the local file if it still exists,
    independent of whether BookOrbit's own delete succeeded, so a caller is
    never left with orphaned bytes on disk because of a BookOrbit-side
    failure.

    Returns ``True`` only if both the BookOrbit-side file row (when found)
    and the on-disk file are gone afterward.
