"""DOM-anchored text extraction for read-along EPUB 3 generation (Phase 1).

``EbookParser.extract_text_and_map`` (``src/utils/ebook_utils.py``) builds a book's
plain-text representation with ``BeautifulSoup(item.get_content(), 'html.parser')``
then ``soup.get_text(separator=' ', strip=True)``. Alignment maps (the bridge's
transcript-to-audio-timestamp maps) live in that exact character space. Generating
SMIL media overlays requires the reverse: given a character offset in that space,
find the source text node and offset inside the *original* spine-item XHTML so a
marker can be inserted there.

``strip=True`` is not invertible from the joined string alone, so this module does
not try to reverse-engineer it. Instead it walks the same DOM tree
``extract_text_and_map`` walked and replicates bs4's own per-node algorithm
directly, recording provenance as it goes:

    bs4's ``Tag._all_strings(strip=True)`` (what ``get_text`` calls) walks
    ``soup.descendants``, keeps only nodes whose *exact* type is
    ``NavigableString`` or ``CData`` (this is what silently drops ``<script>``/
    ``<style>`` content -- those are the distinct ``Script``/``Stylesheet``
    subclasses -- and comments/doctype/processing-instructions), strips each
    surviving string individually, and drops it entirely if stripping empties it.
    ``get_text(separator=' ')`` then joins the surviving *already-stripped*
    strings with a single space. It does NOT join first and strip the result --
    verified against the exact bs4 build pinned in this repo
    (``.venv/Lib/site-packages/bs4/element.py``, ``Tag._all_strings``).

This module re-parses each spine item's *already-captured* ``content`` bytes from
``extract_text_and_map``'s own ``spine_map`` (rather than re-reading the EPUB), so
it can never drift from the exact bytes the reference text was built from, and it
never touches ``EbookParser.cache`` -- it is an ordinary reader of
``extract_text_and_map``'s cached-or-fresh result, exactly like the interface's
other 28 callers.

Node identity is a 0-based index into the *content-string* list for that spine
item (i.e. the same nodes ``get_text`` would enumerate, in document order, before
the empty-after-strip ones are dropped). Re-parsing the same ``content`` bytes
with the same parser is deterministic, so that index is a stable, reproducible
way to relocate the node later (e.g. to insert a SMIL marker span in Phase 3) --
no fragile CSS-selector or XPath scheme required.

    DTD; real EPUB content documents routinely use other named entities
    (``&nbsp;``, ``&mdash;``, ...) without declaring them. This pre-pass makes
    those parseable without ever contacting a network for a DTD.

    ``content`` is decoded as UTF-8 (EPUB content documents are required to be
    UTF-8 or UTF-16, and this repo already treats spine content as UTF-8
